<h3>While it may seem that farming has become and industrial practice that is far from the truth. Large farms only account for 4% of all farms. But only 66% of all sales. That leaves 96% of family farms having  to split only 34% of sales. </h3>
<h3>"The CDC reports that the suicide rate among workers (ages 16-64) has jumped 34% from 12.9 suicides per 100,000 workers in 2000 to 17.3 per 100,000 workers in 2016. Suicides among farmers are 1.5 times higher than the national average, and could be higher because some farm suicides could be masked as farm-related accidents, according to the CDC." </h3>
